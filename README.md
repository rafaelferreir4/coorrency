Coorrency
===========

Currency converter for Drupal.

Instructions
------------

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet... **Just kidding!**

Unpack in the *modules* folder (currently in the root of your Drupal 8
installation) and enable in `/admin/modules`.

Then, visit `/admin/config/services/coorrency` to configure it.

Last, visit `www.example.com/coorrency/convert/from/to` where:
- *from* is the base currency
- *to* is the second currency for conversion.

The module also creates a dynamic block that can be placed anywhere.

Attention
---------

Most bugs have been ironed out, holes covered, features added. But this module
is a work in progress. Please report bugs and suggestions, ok?
